This folder is for ffmpeg.exe as well as required VLC files.

If you already have ffmpeg or VLC installed on your computer
(assuming they're up-to-date), PyPlayer will be able to access
these files automatically. If so, you are free to delete their
associated files from this folder if you wish.

For developers: If you implement a new feature but get unexpected
results, try using a full plugins folder from a VLC installation.
