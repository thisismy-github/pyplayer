This folder is for FFmpeg/FFprobe and required libVLC files.

If you already have FFmpeg, FFprobe, or VLC installed on your
computer (assuming they're up-to-date), PyPlayer will be able
to access these files automatically. If so, you are free to
delete their associated files from this folder if you wish.

For contributors: If you implement a new feature but get
unexpected results, try using a full plugins folder from
a VLC installation.
